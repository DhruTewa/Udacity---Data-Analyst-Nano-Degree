# Udacity---Data-Analyst-Nano-Degree
This repository contains the projects which I completed from the Udacity Nano Degree programs. 

### Prerequisites

* [Python (3.x or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

And additional libraries defined in each project.

 ## Project 1 - Global Weather Trends 
 
It required to apply (atleast) the following steps:
* Extract data from a database using a SQL query
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart 
 
 
 ## Project 2 - No Show Appointments

This project is realted to the data analysis process as whole. From gathering to cleaning, assessing and wrangling to exploring and 
visualizing the data over the programming workflow and communication was everything included. 

This following task were completed in order to finish the project :
- posing questions
- gather, wrangle and clean data 
- communicate answers to the questions 
- assited through visualizations and statistics. 

This project is based on the dataset which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 

## Project 3 - Analyze_A_B Test Analysis
To goal of the project in this chapter was to get experience with A/B testing, it's difficulties and drawbacks of it. 
First of all, we learned what A/B testing is all about - including different metrics like the Click Through Rate (CTR) and
how to analyze these metrics properly. And second of all, we learned about the drawbacks like the novelty effect or change aversion. 

For this project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
My goal was to work through this  to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, 
or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Project 4 - Data Wrangling(In Progress...)

TIn this project we had to deal with the reality of dirty and messy data (again). 
We gathered data from different sources (for example the Twitter API), identified issues with the dataset in terms of tidiness and 
quality. Afterwards we had to solve these problems while documenting each step. The end of the project was then focused on the 
exploration of the data.

## Project 5 - Communicate witn data

For this project I learned about chart junk, uni-, bi- and multivariate visualization, use of color, data/ink ratio.
The task of the final project was to analyze and visualize real-world data. I chose the Ford GoBike dataset.
